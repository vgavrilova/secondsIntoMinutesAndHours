# secondsIntoMinutesAndHours


Hey there!

I've created another converter (yeah, it's a bit boring but I've implemented some other features). With this program you can convert seconds into hours, minutes and remaining seconds in format XXh YYm ZZs.
It's pretty easy but now I've mastered overloading methods and can move forward in my Java course.

Have fun!
